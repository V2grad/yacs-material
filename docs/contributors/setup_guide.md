# Setup Guide

## Welcome!

So you're ready to start working on Yacs!
Or maybe you just want to play around with the app locally.
Either way, this document will take you through what you need to do to get Yacs running on your computer.

## Installation & Setup

### Installating Docker

First, you need to install docker.
There may be exceptions to this, for example if you are only working on one piece of the application you may not need to install everything.
We recommend going through the full setup though, to make sure everything is working properly :)
To install docker, see [Installing Docker](contributors/installing_docker).

### Setting up Git

If you're using Git on your system for the first time, or you have not set up Github to use SSH, you'll need to install either [Git][install-git] or [Github Desktop][install-github-desktop] in order to be able to efficiently contribute to the project (if you're new to Git, we recommend installing Github Desktop or following [this guide][github-instructions]).

If you haven't used Git or Github before, follow [these instructions][github-instructions] from Github.
Make sure your local git name and email are set, and you have your SSH key uploaded to Github (Please use SSH instead of HTTPS).
